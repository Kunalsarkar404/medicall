# 🩺 Medicall — Your Mobile Healthcare Companion

**Medicall** is a full-stack doctor appointment booking platform built with a modern tech stack using **Next.js 15** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. It offers a mobile-first experience focused on real-time booking, easy access to doctors, and a minimal yet powerful MVP.

### Frontend (`/client`)
- **Next.js 15 App Router**
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive UI
- **Axios** or native `fetch` for API communication
- **Next/Image** for optimized profile loading

### Backend (`/server`)
- **Express.js**
- **JWT Authentication** for Doctors
- **Twilio OTP Authentication** for Users
- **MongoDB** (or PostgreSQL, depending on your DB choice)
- **CORS**, **dotenv**, and structured controller-routing

---

## 📱 Core Features

- 📅 Book appointments easily
- 👤 User OTP login via Twilio
